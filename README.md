## 🛠️ My Responsibilities (Nitesh Sharma)

- Developed the **frontend** using **React.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Styled Components**, focusing on clean, reusable, and maintainable code.
- Implemented **JWT-based user authentication** and handled **routing** in both the **Express.js server** and the **React.js application**.
- Designed and developed the **data pipeline** that manages how individual frames travel from the frontend to the backend using **Socket.IO**, ensuring real-time processing.
- Optimized performance by implementing **parallel processing** across multiple servers, reducing latency and increasing accuracy by sending individual frames at **1.3-second intervals**.
- Contributed to the creation and curation of the **dataset** used for training the machine learning model.
